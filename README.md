## Problem statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality business for over 20 years. Recently, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segment due to strong competition and some management challenges. The Managing Director wanted to use data and business intelligence to improve decision-making, but the company does not have an internal analytics team.

### Task List
As a data analyst, I was provided with sample data and a dashboard mock-up. My tasks included:

Creating key performance metrics from the data based on the given list.

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard according to the mock-up provided.

Generating additional insights from the data that were not included in the original metrics or dashboard.

Providing actionable recommendations to help the management make informed business decisions.

Outcome
This analysis helped identify trends in revenue, occupancy, and bookings across different hotels and cities, giving the management clear insights to plan strategies and improve performance.
