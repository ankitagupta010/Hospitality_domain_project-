## Problem statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

# Learnings from the Project:

- Built a calendar visual using a matrix table to analyze data in different ways.

- Explored hotel cancellation policies — most hotels offer free cancellation up to 3 months before booking, then charge 60–90% afterward.

- Used bookmarks and selection for page navigation and filter reset buttons (like website-style navigation).

- Followed a consistent color palette throughout the dashboard for a clean look.

# Key Insights:

- Mumbai generated the highest revenue (₹669M), followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.

- AtliQ Exotica performed best with ₹320M revenue, 3.62 rating, 57% occupancy, and 24.4% cancellations.

- AtliQ Bay had the highest occupancy (66%).

- Week 24 saw the highest revenue (₹139.6M).

- Delhi led in both occupancy and rating.

- Cancellations caused a loss of about ₹298M.

- Elite rooms had the most bookings but also the highest cancellation rate.
